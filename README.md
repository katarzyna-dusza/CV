# CV

This is a source code of my CV available at: [katarzyna-dusza.github.io](https://katarzyna-dusza.github.io).

The project has a similar behavior to [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com). The sections are equivalent to slides, there are a couple of animations like zooming and so on.

## Technologies
- **ES6**
- **jQuery**
- **Webpack**

## Run app
1. Install all dependencies
    ```shell
    yarn install
    ```

2. Run
    ```shell
    npm start
    ```
The application should appear under [localhost](localhost:8080).

## Roadmap

There are a couple of things, which will be improved:
- [ ] make the code more generic -> create an open source library, the first draft is available [here](https://github.com/katarzyna-dusza/slider)
